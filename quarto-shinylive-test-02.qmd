## Quarto + Shinylive

Taking Quarto docs to the next level by embedding live, fully interactive Shiny apps!

Experiment inspired by Joe Cheng's presentation '[Running R-Shiny without a Server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1M6YyU2ZX8)' at posit::conf(2023). (20 min video)

Additional reference:

***Note:** this project set up using '.renv' which is good for reproducibility, but may cause complications for package management on different machines over time.*

## Swiss dataset

R built-in swiss dataset with fertility and socio-economic indicators by province, from 1888.

```{r data}
swiss <- swiss
swiss$prov <- rownames(swiss)
swiss_top <- swiss %>% arrange(-Fertility) %>% slice_head(n=10)
# save with relative location for importing to shiny app below -> doesn't help
write_csv(swiss_top, 'data/swiss_top.csv')
```

## Visualize

Typical static plot produced with ggplot2: useful, but limited:

```{r chart}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-cap: from Swiss Fertility & Socioeconomic Indicators (1888); built-in R dataset.
#| label: fig-swiss

swiss_top %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(prov,Fertility), y=Fertility))+geom_col()+
  geom_hline(yintercept=mean(swiss_top$Fertility), linetype='dashed', color='green')+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.02)))+
  labs(title='Top 10 Swiss Provinces by Fertility', x="", 
       subtitle = '(births per 1,000 women; dotted line = average)')+
  theme_light()+
  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size=11))
```

## Now with Shiny!

Fully interactive chart that leverages R shiny plus webR technology to display in browser...***without*** the need for **shiny server**!

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 700

# load packages
library(shiny)
library(datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(here)

# get data - import saved file with relative location
#swiss_top <- read_csv('data/swiss_top.csv') # failed attempt at reading data
swiss <- datasets::swiss
swiss$prov <- rownames(swiss)
swiss <- swiss %>% arrange(-Fertility)

# Define shiny ui
ui <- fluidPage(
  # shiny UI components here
  # Application title
  titlePanel("Swiss Fertility Data by Province"),
  
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions
  sidebarLayout(
    # Sidebar panel for inputs
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: number of provinces to show (since 47 total)
      numericInput(inputId='num_prov', 
                   label='No. of Provs. to show',
                   value=10, min=1, max=50, step=1),
      # Input: checkbox for the regions to plot - dynamic based on num_prov
      uiOutput('dynamicCheckbox'),
      p('note: 47 provinces in total')
      ), # end sidebarPanel
    
    # Main panel for displaying outputs
    mainPanel(
      h3('Swiss Fertility'),
      # Output: Column chart rendered with ggplot2
      plotOutput(outputId = "fert", height="540px")
    ) # end mainPanel
  )
)

# Define shiny server logic here  
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  # shiny server code
  output$dynamicCheckbox <- renderUI({
     num_provinces <- input$num_prov
     checkboxGroupInput(inputId="prov", "Select Provinces (desc order of fertility)", 
                        choices = head(swiss$prov, num_provinces),
                        select=swiss$prov)
   })
  # Reactive expression to generate the plot based on the inputs
  output$fert <- renderPlot({
    # filter provinces using checklist and num_prov selector
    swiss_top <- swiss %>% filter(prov %in% input$prov)
    # Generate ggplot2 column chart
    swiss_top |> ggplot(aes(x=reorder(prov, Fertility), y=Fertility))+
      geom_col()+
      geom_hline(yintercept=mean(swiss_top$Fertility), 
                 linetype='dashed', color='green')+
      coord_flip()+
      scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05)))+
      labs(title='Swiss Provinces by Fertility (1888)', 
           subtitle = '(births per 1,000 women; dotted line = average)',
           x="")+
      theme_light()+
      theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
            axis.text.y = element_text(size=12))
   })
}

# create and launch shiny app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

Code display doesn't work with the {shinylive-r} code block, so showing the skeleton with shown below. Key unique components:

-   {shinyline-r}
-   #\| standalone: true
-   #\| viewerHeight: 600 - ensures app window is large enough
-   the rest is standard shiny code

```{r eval=FALSE}

{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 600

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Swiss Fertility Data by Province"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      inputs
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput(outputId = "fert")
    )
  )
)

# Define shiny server logic here  
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$fert <- renderPlot({
   })
}

# create and launch shiny app
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## But: Not So Fast...

There are some significant limitations.

### Working with data

By far the most significant, as I'm as I'm concerned:

-   **not able to load external data from outside the shiny app** (as far as I can tell)
    -   no import csv (even local to the quarto project)
    -   no database connection
    -   no read googlesheet
-   I can only use data generated within the app OR built-in R datasets
    -   (*hence the use of the swiss dataset here)*

I haven't been able to figure a way to import data to the app, despite attempting many approaches. So this is a **deal-breaker** for a lot applications - pretty much all of the use cases I would have.

### Other limitations:

-   single file app, so limited complexity
-   hard to debug - no error messages or other clues when app fails
    -   can use [shinylive.io](https://shinylive.io/r/examples/) for testing
-   not all R packages available - but most, so shouldn't be major blocker
-   slow loading time - a nuisance, but generally not unbearable
-   restricted size: limited by format of quarto document

Note that these limitations apply specifically to using Shinylive for embedding into Quarto documents. This is only one use case. Others include:

-   [shinylive.io](https://shinylive.io/r/examples/): for prototyping, potentially sharing apps.
-   [shiny app conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3Nggr9X4rY&t=803s): from regular shiny app that needs a server to serverless app that can be shared more easily.

## Conclusion

This is **powerful technology** that currently has limited application - but will likely become even more valuable over time. Maybe **not ready for primetime**, but will have to **keep an eye on this**!
